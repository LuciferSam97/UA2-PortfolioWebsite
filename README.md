## Description

### Why did I build this project?
The purpose of this project is to be a place where all the applications/scripts I wrote over the course of Ardit Sulce's [Python Mega-Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/) can be displayed alongside links to their github repositories. It served as a more robust introduction to using third-party packages and also a decent introduction to the capabilities of the streamlit package itself.
### What does this project do?
The home page provides a short introduction to myself, and automatically generates the list of applications I created during the course, with the data (including app names, images, github links etc) being read using pandas from a csv file. The website also includes a "contact me" page which allows users to email me directly from the webpage.
### What did I learn?
During this project I learnt how to build multipage streamlit websites, read csv data structures using pandas, and gained experience using Python's built-in smtplib module.
