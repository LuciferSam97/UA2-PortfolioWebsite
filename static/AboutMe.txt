Hello there! My name is Sam, and I'm a mathematician, theoretical physicist and computer programmer from the
Lake District, UK. I did my first degree at Durham University where I read Natural Sciences (Mathematics and Physics)
integrated masters (MSci) graduating in 2021. After a brief stint working as a private tutor, I then completed my
Master of Advanced Study (MASt) in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge in 2024.
