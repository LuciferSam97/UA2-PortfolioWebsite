This section will gradually fill with various bits of code, applications, and programs as I work on practicing and
expanding my skill-set, in particular improving my experience with essential modules such as Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy,
SciPy and Scikit. My interest is predominantly in mathematical modelling and physics simulations, however it will take
some time before these are reasonably expressed by work appearing on this page. At some point in the future, I'd also
like to gain a more comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS, and learning a bit of Javascript. Eventually, I would
like to re-create this website, most likely using Flask or Django, with more control over its design, behaviour,
features, and performance.
