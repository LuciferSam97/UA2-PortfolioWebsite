Currently, this section is empty however I am currently working to expand my skill-set to include experience with
numerical analysis and NumPy, data analysis and scikit, and I also hope to explore some quantum computing with Qiskit.
I also plan on gaining a more comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS, and learning a bit of Javascript. Eventually,
I would like to re-create this website from the ground up with more control over its design, behaviour, features, and
performance.
