Below you can find the apps I built in python as part of Ardit Sulce's [Python Mega-Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/).
I've made an effort to format the README markdown files as professionally as possible although given the nature of these
projects as educational endeavours rather than purpose-driven applications designed and created entirely by me, there were
certain limitations to what the READMEs could reasonably contain. I have many ideas for personal projects to work on and
these will be appearing on this page as they are developed and completed. Hopefully these will be give a clearer representation
of my ability as a programmer and my management of code repositories.
