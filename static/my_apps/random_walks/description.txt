This is a very simple streamlit web-app which plots random walks subject to data entered by the user. The p_value
denotes the probability of the walk stepping down in a given event. The default starting position of the walk is 0,
however this can be changed to another float value, or to a random value selected from a given interval. Reflective
boundaries can also be added, either symmetrically (e.g. 10 would place a reflective boundary at -10 and 10) or
anti-symmetrically (lower and upper bounds are chosen individually.)

This app began life as a playful exercise, attempting to turn the code given [here](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/aph161/assets/tut/t3/t03_stochastic_simulations.html)
into a series of methods performed on a single random walk object. Further changes to the RandomWalk class were
implemented when coupling it to a streamlit UI, e.g. the returnObj option when plotting. I also found the caltech method
for computing a given walk's interaction with a boundary to be a bit limited, so I wrote a new, more general method that
e.g. allows for walks where the initial condition interval straddles a boundary, without the need for additional specialised
methods.

The RandomWalk instance receives its parameters from the "walk_API" dictionary in the session_state and is then stored in the session_state itself. This
assures that there is a clean interface between the data inputted by the user and that which is fed to the RandomWalk
class, allowing for easier handling of errors and preventing changes from appearing until the user applies them by
clicking the "Update" button. Until otherwise updated, the plot will show a default random walk; starting at 0, and
running for 100 steps with `p_value = 0.5` and no boundaries, simulated 100 times. The "Reset" button returns the plot
to displaying this default, and clears the fields. If you wish to clear the fields without resetting the plot, click refresh.
